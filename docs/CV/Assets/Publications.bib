	abstract = {Developmental studies have identified differences in prefrontal and subcortical affective structures between children and adults, which correspond with observed  cognitive and behavioral maturations from relatively simplistic emotional  experiences and expressions to more nuanced, complex ones. However, developmental  changes in the neural representation of emotions have not yet been well explored.  It stands to reason that adults and children may demonstrate observable  differences in the representation of affect within key neurological structures  implicated in affective cognition. Forty-five participants (25 children; 20  adults) passively viewed positive, negative, and neutral clips from popular films  while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using  representational similarity analysis (RSA) to measure variability in neural  pattern similarity, we found developmental differences between children and  adults in the amygdala, nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and ventromedial prefrontal  cortex (vmPFC), such that children generated less pattern similarity within  subcortical structures relative to the vmPFC; a phenomenon not replicated among  their older counterparts. Furthermore, children generated valence-specific  differences in representational patterns across regions; these valence-specific  patterns were not found in adults. These results may suggest that affective  representations grow increasingly dissimilar over development as individuals  mature from visceral affective responses to more evaluative analyses.},

	abstract = {Complications of short bowel syndrome (SBS) include malabsorption and bacterial overgrowth, requiring prolonged dependence on parenteral nutrition (PN). We hypothesized that the intoler­ ance of whole food in some SBS patients might be due to the effect of dietary fiber on the gut microbiome. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing and targeted metabolomics were performed using biospecimens collected from 55 children with SBS and a murine dietary fiber model. Bioinformatic analyses were performed on these datasets as well as from a healthy human dietary intervention study. Compared to healthy controls, the gut microbiota in SBS had lower diversity and increased Proteobacteria, a pattern most pronounced in children on PN and inversely correlated with whole food consumption. Whole food intake correlated with increased glycoside hydrolases (GH) and bile salt hydrolases (BSH) with reduced fecal conjugated bile acids suggesting that dietary fiber regulates BSH activity via GHs. Mechanistic evidence supporting this notion was generated via fecal and plasma bile acid profiling in a healthy human fiber-free dietary intervention study as well as in a dietary fiber mouse experiment. Gaussian mixture modeling of fecal bile acids was used to identify three clinically relevant SBS phenotypes. Dietary fiber is associated with bile acid deconju­ gation likely via an interaction between gut microbiota BSHs and GHs in the small intestine, which may lead to whole food intolerance in patients with SBS. This mechanism not only has potential utility in clinical phenotyping and targeted therapeutics in SBS based on bile acid metabolism but may have relevance to other intestinal disease states.},

	abstract = {As individuals navigate the world, they are bound to have emotionally intense experiences. These events not only influence momentary physiological and affective responses, but may also have a powerful impact on one’s memory for their emotional experience. In this research, we used the naturalistic context of a haunted house to examine how physiological arousal is associated with metacognitive emotional memory (i.e., the extent to which an individual remembers having experienced a certain emotion). Participants first navigated the haunted house while heart rate and explicit situational appraisals were recorded, and then recalled specific events from the haunted house and the intensity of these affective events approximately one week later. We found that heart rate predicted both the intensity of reported scariness in the haunted house and meta-cognitive memory of affect during recall. Critically, we found evidence for malleability in metacognitive emotional memory based on how the event was initially labeled. Individuals tended to recall events that they explicitly labeled as fear-evoking as being more intense than they reported at the time of the event. We found the opposite relationship for events that they labeled as not fear-evoking. Taken together, this indicates that there are strong relationships between physiological arousal and emotional experiences in naturalistic contexts, but that affective labeling can modulate the relationship between these features when reflecting on the emotionality of that experience in memory.},
