    "text": "Hi, I’m Billy Mitchell\nI’m a fifth-year PhD Candidate in Chelsea Helion’s Social and Affective Neuroscience lab who uses naturalistic paradigms to study neural representations of uncertainty, emotion, and self-regulation. I also co-direct the Coding Outreach Group which is a student-led organization aiming to increase computer programming literacy and to build an educational community with self-generated resources for coders of all levels.\nI’d graduated from Loyola University Maryland, after which I coordinated some really interesting nicotine and cannabinoid studies at Johns Hopkins University and GI microbiome research at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.\nWhen I’m not working, I like hiking, playing Dungeons & Dragons (See my R functions in the DnDRuf Repo or my Combat Simulator App!), and making music."
