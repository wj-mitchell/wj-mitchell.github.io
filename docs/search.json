I often prioritize high ecological-validity in my study designs and am drawn towards computational methodologies and novel statistical techniques.\n\n\nWhen I’m not working, I like hiking, playing tabletop RPGs (See my R functions in the DnDRuf Repo or my Combat Simulator App!), and making music.\n\n\nI have proudly served many organizing roles within my union - TUGSA - including strike coordinator and union steward. I’m am currently a staff organizer dedicated to providing technical support to the Temple University Graduate Student Association and a member of Rutgers AAUP-AFT. As someone from a low SES background with no college in my family history, I am accutely aware of the effects that economics play in making education and a career in education accessible. Collective action is how we fix it.\n\n\nPerseverance Conquers"

I recently completed a Cognition & Neuroscience PhD at Temple University and I am now a post-doctorate fellow at Rutgers University Newark.

    "text": "Please Note:\nIn March 2025, the Trump administration more or less illegitimately terminated the D-SPAN funding mechanism. As such no future applications will be meaningfully considered, though I believe you can still technically submit as of March 2025. This is an unprecedented attack on science and cannot be tolerated. I am leaving all of my documentation on the subject up and otherwise unaltered. I doubt that it will serve the purpose I intended - to help applicants win this award - but will likely now exist as a memorial and reminder of what we lose when we allow our fears and lesser impulses to drive our politics. Diversity grants don’t produce lesser scientists—they make sure that brilliant under-resourced people aren’t quietly forced out of academia like a virus from a body. If we let this happen, we’re not just losing the people who are going to cure cancers, solve dementia, and ease the sufferings that touch everyone."

This funding mechanism, in my opinion, is not as well known as it should be. I wanted to document and share my experience to help others learn about the grant and know what to expect, so I’ve made everything available at this publicly accessible repository. This includes\n\nGeneral information about the grant\nThe narrative of my experience, including my scores, feedback, and timeline of all important dates.\nMaterials including resources I found helpful, application materials, summary statements, response to critiques, just in time documents, and products relevant to this research (presentations I’ve done, manuscripts, etc.)\n\nBoth the README and the repository landing page should have this information detailed."
