I use naturalistic paradigms to study how we dynamically resolve uncertainty in social situations. I also research neural representations of emotion and how people regulate their emotions. I often prioritize high ecological-validity in my study designs and am drawn towards computational methodologies and novel statistical techniques.\n\n\nWhen I’m not working, I like hiking, playing tabletop RPGs (See my R functions in the DnDRuf Repo or my Combat Simulator App!), and making music.\n\n\nI have proudly served many organizing roles within my union - TUGSA - including strike coordinator and union steward. As someone from a low SES background with no college in my family history, I am accutely aware of the effects that economics play in making education and a career in education accessible. Collective action is how we fix it.\n\n\nPerseverence Conquers"
