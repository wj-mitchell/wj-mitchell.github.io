# Study Materials and Infomration. 
In February 2024, I am presenting my research using high-intensity, feature-rich dynamic settings to study emotion regulation usage at the SPSP 2024 Conference. The manuscript is currently under review at the *Journal of Experimental Psychology: General*, but all of the materials associated with it can be found on the project's [OSF page](https://osf.io/j5sku/) and this [Github repository](https://github.com/wj-mitchell/fright_night_study), including the [most recent copy of the manuscript](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/23wtz). 

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out at [billy.mitchell@temple.edu](mailto:billy.mitchell@temple.edu).
