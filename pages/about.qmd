<h2 style="text-align: center; max-width: 25ch;"> About Me </h2>

<p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 50ch;">I had completed my PhD in Chelsea Helion's <a href="https://www.tu-sanlab.com/">Social and Affective Neuroscience lab</a> where I used naturalistic paradigms to study how we dynamically resolve uncertainty in social situations, represent emotions, and regulate our emotions in high-stress situations. I often prioritize high ecological-validity in my study designs and am drawn towards computational methodologies and novel statistical techniques.</p>
  
<p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 50ch;"> When I'm not working, I like hiking, playing tabletop RPGs (See my R functions in the <a href="https://github.com/wj-mitchell/DnDRuf"><i>DnDRuf Repo</i></a> or my <a href="https://wjpmitchell3.shinyapps.io/CombatSim/"><i>Combat Simulator App</i></a>!), and making <a href="https://doorprizeband.bandcamp.com/releases">music</a>.</p> 

<p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 50ch;">I have proudly served many organizing roles within my union - <a href="https://tugsa.org/">TUGSA</a> - including strike coordinator and union steward. I'm am currently a staff organizer dedicated to providing technical support to the Temple University Graduate Student Association and a member of Rutgers AAUP-AFT. As someone from a low SES background with no college in my family history, I am accutely aware of the effects that economics play in making education and a career in education accessible. Collective action is how we fix it. </p>
