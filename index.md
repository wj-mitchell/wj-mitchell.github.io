I am a fifth year PhD Candidate in [Dr. Ingrid Olson's laboratory](http://www.olson-lab.com/) at Temple University. I completed my B.S. in psychology at Virginia Commonwealth University. Afterwards, I worked as a post-bac in two labs, first at the NIH and then at the Martinos Center, before starting a PhD program with Dr. Olson. 

My research focuses on the cerebellum's contributions to social cognition. 
The cerebellum is often excluded when trying to understand the neural 
processes underlying social cognition. However, recent work has shown that it is implicated in a variety of social tasks and psychiatric disorders with social deficits. My research aims to differentiate the cerebellum's contribution to social cognition, from that of the more well-understood regions of the cerebrum.
